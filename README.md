# IoT_BeaconRepository
 Using Beacon, this web service provides CMU beacon's fine/coarse grained location database.

### Sensors are everywhere!
>BLE beacon sensors and your mobile devices
You can locate where you are in the building even in the floor and corridor. 


### Indoor Location Positioning
Now you can locate where you are at the specific building, floor and corridor.
You can see where the hot spot is in CMU. Currently Sesnsors are deployed NSH, Wean Hall and Gates Hall. More to come! Some sensors are attached to hot spots like Cafe or Student Lounge. You can now post and subscribe all the events to those spots.
### REST API
>The Indoor location positioning API is based on REST API and JSON so that it is very easy to use. We provide fine-grained and coarse-grained location positioning services. For example, as for "fine-grained" mode, you will get "I am nearby Tazza Coffee serving table in the Gates Building 3F" whereas in "corase-grained mode"
you will get "I am in the Gates Building 3F".
