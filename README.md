# IoT_BeaconRepository
 Using Beacon, this web service provides CMU beacon's fine/coarse grained location database.

### Sensors are everywhere!
              <h2>BLE beacon sensors &amp; your mobile devices</h2>
              <p> You can locate where you are in the building even in the floor and corridor. </p>

### Indoor Location Positioning
Now you can locate where you are at the specific building, floor and corridor.</p>
You can see where the hot spot is in CMU. Currently Sesnsors are deployed NSH, Wean Hall and Gates Hall. More to come! </Some sensors are attached to hot spots like Cafe or Student Lounge. You can now post and subscribe all the events to those spots. </p>
### REST API</h3>
              <p>The Indoor location positioning API is based on REST API and JSON so that it is very easy to use. We provide fine-grained and coarse-grained location positioning services. For example, as for "fine-grained" mode, you will get "I am nearby Tazza Coffee serving table in the Gates Building 3F" whereas in "corase-grained mode"
you will get "I am in the Gates Building 3F".</p>
